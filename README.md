# Sentiment_Analysis-using-NLP

### Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.
#### For this project we have used the libraries 
1) Sklearn
2) Pandas
3) Wordcloud
4) Matplotlib
5) Seaborn
6) nltk

## Observations :-
| Model | Accuracy | 
|-----------|:-----------:| 
| Naive Bayes | 85.21% | 
| Random Forest | 85.44% |
| Logistic Regression | 89.48% |

### Result:- 
We can see that among the three models Logistic Regression gives the best results.
